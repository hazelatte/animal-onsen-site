          Animal Onsen is a cozy bathhouse sim where gentle routines and little
          rituals turn into a tiny world of calm. This is placeholder copy that
          will later describe the core loop, the setting, and the overall mood.

          Placeholder paragraph for feature one: describe the onsen upgrades,
          soothing ambience, and why animals keep coming back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Placeholder paragraph for feature two: talk about collecting
          ingredients, customizing baths, or discovering new visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Placeholder paragraph for feature three: hint at story beats, seasonal
          events, or surprises tucked into the mountains.
